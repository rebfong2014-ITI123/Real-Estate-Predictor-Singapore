Key Steps:
Permalink: Key Steps:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Explore and extract relevant features to improve the model's predictive performance.
Model Architecture: Design and implement a Deep Neural Network architecture using TensorFlow and Keras, considering the complexity of the problem.
Training: Train the model on the preprocessed dataset, optimizing hyperparameters for better performance.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Visualization: Visualize key insights and trends in the data, as well as the model's predictions.
Deployment: Optionally, deploy the trained model for real-time predictions or integrate it into a web application.
